## About

ReThread is a web-based platform that connects handloom weavers, artisans, designers, and consumers to collect, exchange, and upcycle textile waste generated during handloom production and from post-consumer handloom products. The platform enables a circular value chain: waste is collected, repurposed by artisans, and reintroduced into the marketplace as new, valuable handloom products.

## Problem Statement

Despite the inherent sustainability of handloom production compared to fast fashion, significant textile waste (yarn scraps, fabric offcuts, damaged pieces) is still generated during the weaving process and from post-consumer handloom products. This waste often ends up in landfills, contributing to environmental degradation.

There is a lack of organized, accessible channels to collect, sort, and effectively upcycle these materials back into valuable handloom products or other sustainable goods, hindering the full realization of a circular economy within the handloom sector.

**Core question:** How might we create a digital platform that connects handloom weavers, artisans, and consumers to facilitate the collection, exchange, and upcycling of textile waste generated from handloom production and post-consumer handloom products, thereby reducing landfill waste and fostering innovative, sustainable handloom creations?

## Solution overview

**ReThread: Handloom Circularity Hub** is a centralized marketplace + community hub focused on textile waste from the handloom sector. It enables collection, exchange, and upcycling by connecting material generators (weavers, producers, households) with upcyclers (artisans, designers, small manufacturers) and conscious consumers.

**Core goal:** Reduce textile waste, create new revenue streams for artisans, and educate consumers about circular fashion practices within the handloom ecosystem.

## How it works (user flows)

1. **Material listing (Weavers / Donors):** Producers and consumers can list available textile waste (yarn scraps, offcuts, damaged pieces) with photos, quantities, material details, and pickup/delivery options.
2. **Discovery (Artisans / Designers):** Makers browse available listings, request samples, reserve lots, or propose collaborative upcycling projects.
3. **Collection & Logistics:** Platform coordinates collection through volunteer networks, local collection centers, or courier logistics (configurable by region).
4. **Upcycling & Productization:** Artisans upcycle materials into new products. Each upcycled product includes provenance metadata — where materials came from and who upcycled them.
5. **Marketplace & Community:** Finished products are sold on the platform; buyers can learn about the upcycle story and support artisans directly. Community features include tutorials, idea-sharing, and match-making for collaborative projects.

## Key features

* Material listings with images, material types, and quantities
* Search & filters (material type, location, pickup options, estimated yardage)
* Reservation & sample request workflow
* Logistics coordination (local drop-off points, pick-up scheduling)
* Upcycling project pages (process, maker bio, before/after photos)
* Marketplace for upcycled products and direct messaging between users
* Provenance & sustainability metrics (waste diverted, CO₂/landfill estimates)
* Community resources: tutorials, design challenges, and events

## Impact

ReThread directly addresses environmental and socio-economic goals:

* Diverts textile waste from landfills and reduces the environmental footprint of the handloom sector.
* Creates new income streams for artisans and small-scale makers by turning waste into sellable goods.
* Fosters innovation in upcycling techniques and design within the handloom community.
* Raises consumer awareness about circular fashion and encourages donation/repurposing behavior.

## User personas

* **Handloom Weaver / Producer:** Small-scale weaver who generates scraps and offcuts and wants a low-friction channel to sell or donate materials.
* **Upcycling Artisan / Designer:** Maker seeking low-cost, authentic handloom materials to create unique products and access new markets.
* **Conscious Consumer / Donor:** Someone who owns handloom items they no longer use and wants them upcycled rather than thrown away.
* **Local Collector / NGO:** Community partner that aggregates donations and helps coordinate logistics for a region.

## Tech stack 

* **Core Framework**: Next.js 15 with React 18. This provides the foundation for the application, handling server-side rendering, routing (using the App Router), and overall structure.

* **Language**: TypeScript. All the code is written in TypeScript (.ts, .tsx) to ensure type safety and improve code quality, which helps prevent bugs.

* **UI Components**: ShadCN UI. This is not a traditional component library but a collection of reusable UI components (like Button, Card, Input) built on top of Radix UI. You can see all these components in your src/components/ui folder.

* **Styling**: Tailwind CSS. This utility-first CSS framework is used for all the styling. It allows for rapid UI development by composing utility classes directly in the code. The specific theme colors, fonts, and other design tokens are configured in src/app/globals.css and tailwind.config.ts.

* **Form Management**: React Hook Form is used to manage form state, and Zod is used for schema validation. This powerful combination makes it easy to handle complex forms, like the ones for listing waste or applying for a partnership, ensuring that the user-submitted data is correct.

* **AI Integration**: Genkit is the framework used to connect to and manage interactions with Google's Gemini AI models. This powers your "AI Material Recommender" feature, with the logic defined in src/ai/flows/material-recommender.ts.

* **Icons**: Lucide React. This is a simple and clean icon library used throughout the application for clear and consistent iconography.



> Note: This stack is optimized for rapid hackathon development and smooth Firebase integration (Auth + Hosting + Firestore + Storage).

## Getting started (developer guide)

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ReThread-Project-.git
cd ReThread-Project-
```

2. Install dependencies (example for a React app):

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev   # or `npm start` depending on setup
```

4. Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

5. (Optional) Deploy to Firebase Hosting:

```bash
# install the CLI once
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
# initialize hosting (run once)
firebase init hosting
# build your app so the output matches the `public` folder you set
npm run build
# deploy
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

## Roadmap — Short (Hackathon → MVP → Scale)

* **MVP (Hackathon):** Material listing, discovery, basic messaging, simple marketplace, user authentication, and image upload.
* **Phase 2:** Logistics integration, reservation workflow, provenance metadata and sustainability metrics, payment integration.
* **Phase 3:** Regional collection partners, community events, mobile apps, analytics dashboard, partnerships with NGOs/marketplaces.
